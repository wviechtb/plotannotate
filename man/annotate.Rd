\description{
   Function to add annotations to a plot.
}
\usage{
annotate(col=c("black","red","green","blue"), lwd=c(4,4,30), cex=c(1,1), info=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
   \item{col}{a vector of colors (can be up to length 9).}
   \item{lwd}{a numeric vector to specify the line width for freehand drawing, for symbols, and the eraser.}
   \item{cex}{a numeric vector to specify the size of points and text.}
   \item{info}{a logical to specify whether visual information about the drawing mode and colors should be shown while annotating a plot.}
}
\details{

   This is the main function of the package. After creating a plot, for example with \code{\link{plot}()}, the command \code{annotate}() enters a freehand drawing mode where one can draw on the plot (by pressing the left mouse button and dragging the pointer across the plot).

   Various keys can be used to change the drawing mode or to adjust the settings:

   \tabular{lll}{
   \bold{key} \tab \ics \tab \bold{function} \cr
   \verb{q}   \tab \ics \tab Quit the \code{annotate()} function. The right mouse button can also be used for this purpose. \cr
   \verb{1-9} \tab \ics \tab Select one of the colors from the ones specified via the \code{col} argument. \cr
   \verb{d}   \tab \ics \tab Change to freehand drawing mode as explained above. \cr
   \verb{p}   \tab \ics \tab Change to point drawing mode. Click on a location of the plot to add a point. \cr
   \verb{l}   \tab \ics \tab Change to line drawing mode. Click on a location, hold the mouse button, move the pointer to a different location, and release the mouse button to draw a line. \cr
   \verb{a}   \tab \ics \tab Change to arrow drawing mode. Works like the line drawing mode. The arrowhead is shown at the release location. \cr
   \verb{A}   \tab \ics \tab Change to arrow drawing mode with arrowheads at both ends. \cr
   \verb{r}   \tab \ics \tab Change to rectangle drawing mode. Works like the line drawing mode. \cr
   \verb{c}   \tab \ics \tab Change to circle drawing mode. Works like the line drawing mode. \cr
   \verb{t}   \tab \ics \tab Change to text drawing mode. Click on a location (which enters type mode), type some text, and after hitting \verb{enter} the text is added next to the click location. Note that the text typed is not shown until hitting \verb{enter}. The \verb{escape} key cancels the text entry. \cr
   \verb{-+}  \tab \ics \tab Decrease/increase the line width or point/text size. The default sizes are set by the \code{lwd} and \code{cex} arguments. Can also use \verb{=} instead of \verb{+} or the down and up arrow keys for the same purpose. \cr
   \verb{s}   \tab \ics \tab Toggle snap mode, so that lines/arrows are drawn exactly horizontally/vertically. \cr
   \verb{u}   \tab \ics \tab Undo (i.e., remove) annotations that have been added to the plot by drawing on top of them with the background color of the plot. Therefore, any elements underneath an annotation that is removed in this manner will also be drawn over. \cr
   \verb{e}   \tab \ics \tab Change to eraser mode. Like the freehand drawing mode, except that the background color is used for drawing. \cr
   \verb{z}   \tab \ics \tab Redraw the entire plot without the annotations. This relies on \code{\link{recordPlot}} and \code{\link{replayPlot}} working correctly. \cr
   \verb{x}   \tab \ics \tab Fix the current state of the plot (i.e., runs \code{\link{recordPlot}}) so \verb{z} redraws the plot in this state. \cr
   \verb{b}   \tab \ics \tab Make the plot completely blank. See also \code{\link{blank}} for creating a blank plot. \cr
   \verb{i}   \tab \ics \tab Toggle \code{info} on/off. \cr
   }

   When \code{info=TRUE} (the default), then information about the drawing mode and colors are shown at the top left while annotating a plot. Note that this information may overlap with the plot title or other elements.

   After annotating a plot, it should be possible to save the plot including the annotations with \code{\link{dev.print}}, for examaple using something like \code{dev.print(device=png, filename="plot.png", width=<width>, height=<height>)}. However, by default, the plot will have a transparent background color, which is typically not what is desired. To avoid this issue, one can use \code{par(bg="white")} before creating the plot to set a white background color.
