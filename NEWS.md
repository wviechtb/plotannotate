# plotannotate 1.3-0 (2025-06-20)

- improved the circle drawing code, so that either the x- or y-axis distance properly determines the circle radius

- added circle and ellipse drawing modes that work like freehand drawing but the nearest circle/ellipse corresponding to the input coordinates is drawn (makes use of the `conicfit` package)

- added a smooth mode for freehand drawing

- much faster undo for freehand drawing

- can now toggle through four different point symbols and three different line types

- info at the top now also shows the drawing mode; can click on the boxes to select the mode / color (or to toggle smooth/snap)
